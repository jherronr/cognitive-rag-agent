Loss Aversion
• Clear Definition: Loss aversion is a bias where individuals prefer to avoid losses more than they wish to acquire equivalent gains
. The pain experienced from an investment loss can be two to three times greater than the pleasure felt from a comparable gain. This greater sensitivity to losses can lead to poor or irrational financial decisions
.
• Actionable Coping Strategies:
    1. Reduce Portfolio Risk: You can seek to lower risk for a given level of expected return through more effective portfolio construction
. Lowering risk can increase the likelihood of achieving acceptable outcomes, especially for an investor who feels the pain of a loss more acutely than the pleasure of a gain
.
    2. Determine Your "Highest Acceptable Loss": Before investing, identify your maximum tolerance for loss
. A way to frame this is to ask yourself, "If my £100,000 investment for retirement declines to £90,000 one year from now, how would I react?". Understanding this helps in building a suitable portfolio and preparing for potential losses.
